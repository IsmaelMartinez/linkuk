### Manage Facilities and Services

Navigate to "<path to linksf instance>/admin" in your browser while linksf is running, and log in with the credentials that you used to create your admin user in Firebase. If you already imported Locations, you should see a list.

To add new Locations/Services, click the 'New Location' or 'New Service' link in the top bar to the right of the search bar. You'll see a form to fill out to create new locations/services.

To edit existing locations/services, just click a name in the list view and the same form will appear. You can return to the list view at any time by clicking the link at top left.

**TODO** Edit for our new admin page layout
